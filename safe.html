    <h1>Crypto Safety</h1>

    <h5>Blocchains handle a lot in the world of crypto, as it keeps track of every single transaction made. This makes it incredibly challenging to get by. A bank, on the other hand, is much easier to break into.</h5>

    <p>
        To start, cryptocurrencies are very secure compared to the currencies we use today. 
        <br>
        Cryptocurrencies are decentralized, meaning that there is no third party, usually banks, involved. It is peer-to-peer(P2P). 
        <br>
        Blockchains are not placed in one specific computer or location, hence the name decentralized.
        <br> 
        This makes sure that no one can easily hack the blockchain, because it is located on computers throughout the whole network. 
        <br>
        These blockchains are always updated whenever a new transaction is made, and there is a record kept. 
        <br>
        If something is not right, the network will check if something has been tampered with, and because of the technology, the blockchain can easily find the “black hat” (a black hat is a hacker that breaches security and, hacks, for nothing more than personal gain). 
        <br>
        Even so, it is very hard to hack a blockchain. Since the blockchain is not in a central location, “it can never be changed from a single computer” (Ashford).
