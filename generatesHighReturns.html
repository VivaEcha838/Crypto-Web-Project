    <h1>Crypto Generates High Returns</h1>

   <p>
      Bitcoin is amazing at generating high returns. When people invest, their goal is to make money. 
      <br>
      I am comparing Bitcoin with Vanguard 500 Index. Vanguard 500 Index takes the Top 500 companies and will put your money that you invest into each of the 500 companies. 
      <br>
      It will invest based off the market cap. For example, a larger percent of your money is going to the companies with the higher market cap, such as Apple, Microsoft, and Google. 
      <br>
      I used Portfolio Visualizer to compare how much I would make if I, theoretically, put $1,000 into Bitcoin and Vanguard in 2009 and sold that money today. 
      <br>
      This is when the first Bitcoin was “mined” into existence. The results were shocking. I would have only had $2,461 with Vanguard, while I would have more than $78,000 with Bitcoin. 
      <br>
      While Bitcoin had some down years, that was expected since the currency and coin were both new and this kind of investing scared people. 
      <br>
      Eventually, the supply started to decrease and eventually become scarce, and the price increased.
